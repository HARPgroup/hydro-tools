\title{Calculates the group2 IHA statistics}
\usage{
group2(x, yearType = c("water", "calendar"), mimic.tnc = T, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A zoo timeseries object containing the flow series}

\item{yearType}{The type of year factor to be used when determining statistcs,
\code{yr = 'water'} or \code{yr ='calendar'} for water years and calculated years respectively}

\item{mimic.tnc}{should the function perform the calculation like the TNC IHA
software? If mimic.tnc is TRUE, then running means will be calculated for each
year individually and will not use data from the previous or next year, thereby}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to ddply. Likely not used without
modificiation to this function}
}
\value{
a data frame with the group 2 statistics for each year
}
\description{
The group 2 statistics measure the magnitude of monthly water condition and
include 12 parameters. This will calculate several metrics for each year of
the 1-D zoo input x.
}
\details{
This function divides the zoo by water or calendar year
and finds the 1, 3, 7, 30, and 90 day rolling averages of the zoo. Then, it 
finds the range, base index, and days of zero flow of each year, with base 
index defined as the minimum 7-day flow divided by the average flow
}
\examples{
library(dataRetrieval)
gageData <- dataRetrieval::readNWISdv("01634500","00060")
gageFlow <- zoo(test[,4],order.by = test$Date)
group2(gageFlow,'water',TRUE)
